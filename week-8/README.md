# Week 8: A/B Testing

## Reading Assignment

Introduction to [Fairness and Machine Learning: Limitations and Opportunities](https://fairmlbook.org/pdf/fairmlbook.pdf) by Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt, Arvind Narayanan.

## References

I really like the paper [Controlled experiments on the web: survey and practical guide](http://www.robotics.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/2009controlledExperimentsOnTheWebSurvey.pdf).  Some of the lecture was taken from there.
