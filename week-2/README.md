# Week 2: Data is Messy

This week we start our first big project, which will last three weeks.

This project uses the San Diego Police Department 2016 traffic stop data.  The city makes a bunch of interesting data available at https://data.sandiego.gov/

By the end of this week you will be able to:

* Work with messy real-world data
* Identify when data is bad, and what to do about it
* Perform more sophisticated analysis in Tableau, including aggregations, formulas and new plot types
